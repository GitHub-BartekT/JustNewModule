# Just New Module
The **Just New Module** application creates structures for new modules.
It significantly reduces the time needed to create a new functionality structure.
This allows you to focus on coding business logic, not on repetitive tasks.

## How it works
### Problem
IT projects are organized to ensure easy navigation.
When creating a new feature, you often need to repeatedly create the same files from scratch.
For example, in a hexagonal architecture, you might create: 
* ModulePort
* ModuleFacade
* ModuleMapper
* ModuleRepository
* Module (Entity)
* ModuleDto, or
  * ModuleReadModel
  * ModuleWriteModel
* ModuleNotFoundException
* ModuleController

There are numerous repetitive files to create before you can even start coding the business logic.

### Solution
The **Just New Module** app generates all these files with the required annotations automatically.
* If you use Spring Boot, it adds ```@Service``` and other annotations.
* If you use Lombok, it adds Lombok's annotations.

Once you adjust the project structure to your needs, the app can create REST-based projects automatically.
